TL;DR - A torrent software lets you download files from other users instead of from a server. Torrent is the standard for sharing pirated files as it is near-impossible to take down the file once it is shared.

A Torrent File is a file that is being shared Peer-to-peer from several personal computers as opposed to being hosted on a server. This means the file is near impossible to take down or modify, so long as at least one computer is seeding the file. Once you acquire a .torrent file, open it in QBittorrent and download the file you want. Once the file is downloaded, QBittorrent will automatically begin seeding so that others may download the file from your computer. Seeding uses minimal bandwidth, but if you don't want to share the file you can stop it at any time.
