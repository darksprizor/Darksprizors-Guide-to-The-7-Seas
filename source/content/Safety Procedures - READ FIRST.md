# VPN
Simple Explanation: A VPN hides your IP Address when browsing the web. This prevents many issues such as:
	Your ISP from blocking or throttling connection to certain websites
	Your location being seen by any website you connect to
	Bad actors from attacking your network(DDOS, Malware, etc.)
Recommended VPN: [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/) 
	Open Source free VPN based in Switzerland(paid version available). No logs policy. 
# Virus Protection
It is recommended to scan all files with [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) prior to running the software to make sure that it is safe. Don't bother with an antivirus, they are pointless bloatware that slow down your hardware. Windows Defender does just fine. 
# Browser & Adblocker
Recommended Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
	Firefox is a private and open source browser developed by Mozilla. Google has historically been malicious regarding data privacy and the prevention of antivirus software on their products, so it's generally best to avoid using whenr possible.
Recommended Adblocker: [Ublock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)
